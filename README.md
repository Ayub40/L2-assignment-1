                                                                TypeScript, both interface and types can used to defines the shape of a object. Their are some different in their feature and use: 

Interface:

1. Declared using the interface keyword.
2. Typically used to define the shape of objects or classes.

Example:
   interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Ayub",
  age: 30,
};

Type:
 1. You canâ€™t types with same name.
 2. Can still describe objects, like interface.

Example: 
  type EmilabWatch = {
        brand: string;
        model: string;
        display: string;
    }
